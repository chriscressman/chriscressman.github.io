did it in my free time
demonstrates my interest and expertise in Elastic
not docs, but similar
should do a longer write up on this one
Presentation was important project because I had to study the code of
9 libraries that were new to me
not workarea
and I had limited time to produce something of value
found a way to contribute something unique and creative rather than
just walk through API calls
wrote significant portions of a rails app for this presentation
to have consistent, cohesive code examples
and to learn by doing
getting things done
you get shit done

<!--
make it clear that workarea isn&#39;t a normal library/framework
not a toolkit for building things
but an almost-finished product that needs to be connected and extended
needs to be &quot;finished&quot;
The more contexts in which you learn/experience something,
the more you create abstract models of that thing
and the less you rely on any specific/concrete example
you therefore become better at apply that knowledge to something
you haven&#39;t seen before
which is the essence of creativity
being able to apply knowledge/skills from one discipline to another,
because you&#39;ve developed a mental model of it that is abstracted
from specific concrete examples

<!--
strong introduction, this is what I was focusing on when I wrote this
very recent
conceptual
no summary, but I could add one
Integrate an Inventory Management system
should also consider this
define and configure inventory policies
nice short procedural doc
the value of having the skills of an engineer
when documenting payment tenders
the design of the platform does not formally distinguish between
advance payment tenders and primary tenders
but that distinction is useful to engineers implementing their own tenders
so I discovered that distinction by observing patterns in implementations
and called it out as a concept in the docs
and used it to fork my examples as needed to cover the two types

        <h2 id="workarea-training-exercises">Workarea Training Exercises</h2>
<!--
this training followed a cohesive narrative that revolved around important Workarea domain concepts:
products, merchandising, and orders
(I like to explain ecommerce systems as machines that take a catalog of products as their input,
merchandise them to encourage sales,
and product orders as their output)
the design for this training involved 3 parts:
a virtualized, turnkey development environment to get each developer (windows, mac, or linux)
up and running with a workarea application with all its dependencies
in a matter of minutes
a series of 26 exercises, which participants would complete (hands on) over the next 4 days
lecture/presentation materials
conducted as a workshop more than a lecture, although there were guest speakers
who were primarily there to lecture, answer questions, and otherwise break up the day
also intended to hold up as a &quot;take home&quot; set of practice exercises
that the devs could use to further practice and develop the skills
peak
deliberate practice
framework for skill acquisition (skills vs knowledge)
develop your mental model(s)
through focused exercises
that make you struggle
and provide feedback
that allows you to correct your mistakes
and improve
I&#39;m proud of these exercises given the time spent on them and the value the company
got from them
My only regret is not making them test-driven, but I ran out of time
Surprising, these held up for 2+ years of trainings by multiple trainers
without any changes or additions

        <h2 id="learn-rails-initialization">Learn Rails Initialization</h2>
        <p>Rails gives you a lot of places to put initialization code, and the order in which they run is only partially documented. Once, Rails initialization order caused a problem for us twice in the same week, so I decided I wanted to solve this problem. Sometimes the best way to learn is by doing, so I created an application which resembled a real-world Workarea application (with several plugins installed). Then I inserted logging code all throughout the application and plugin to log every possible place initialization could be run.</p>
        <p>The resulting log provided a definitive answer to the order in which all Rails initializers are run. I shared this with the team. This probably took me a couple hours at most and solved an issue that had been hurting us for a while.</p>
        <p>I like to learn through experimentation and exploration. I regularly create disposable applications to answer specific questions about the software. In this case I happened to keep the app as a reference for me and the team, which is good so I can share it with you here.</p>

        <h2 id="javascript-trivia">JavaScript Trivia</h2>
        <p>As the front-end engineering team lead, I organized and often presented at regular team meetings, which were like internal engineering “meetups” where we’d share knowledge and skills and cultivate our community. At one point, we were trying to build our JavaScript skills across the team. To make this more fun, I created some JavaScript trivia, and we spent several meetings in a row testing our knowledge and explaining each answer. The team enjoyed this because it was interactive, engaging, and <em>challenging</em>. I wrote this many years ago while I was actively engaged in learning JavaScript. I don’t think I could answer many of these now, so please don’t quiz me!</p>

        <h2 id="baseball-score-sheet">Baseball Score Sheet</h2>
        <p>I played a lot of sports growing up, but as an adult I had the pleasure of being on a baseball team with my two younger brothers, and my dad was the coach. Having been removed from sports for many years, I wasn’t a very good player, but I had a lot of fun keeping score at each game. However, the store-bought score sheets we used were a little too “busy” for me. So, I created my own–in HTML and CSS of course!</p>
        <p>
          <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bitbucket.org/chriscressman/baseball-score-sheet/src/master/">

            <img alt="new window" src="external-link-icon.svg">
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>While a nice score sheet indeed, I include this here mostly to bring up my background in organized sports. Team sports, particularly demanding year-round sports, likely played a large role in shaping who I am today. I attribute many import life and business lessons to my experiences on these teams, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Determination: “showing up” (literally and figuratively) every day, even when it’s hard or you don’t want to</li>
          <li>Rapid learning and skill development: drills, repetition, pushing beyond your comfort zone</li>
          <li>Reflection: learning from your mistakes; seeing them as opportunities to improve</li>
          <li>Mission: sharing a vision with others who are equally determined; being a part of something larger than yourself</li>
          <li>Achievement: trusting the process; watching small gains compound into great achievements</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I presented this talk internally at Workarea and then again at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://2013.barcampphilly.org/">Barcamp Philadelphia 2013</a>. It’s therefore an example of my earlier teaching and community work.</p>
        <p>Although HTML slides are nothing new today, the slideshow tool I wrote for this was pretty novel at the time, and several members of the Barcamp audience complimented me on it. If you feel like checking it out, you can clone the repository:</p>
