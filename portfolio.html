        <h2 id="architecting-a-search-feature">Architecting a Search Feature</h2>
        <p>This presentation, delivered to the <cite>Lanacaster Elastic User Group</cite> this past August, demonstrates my ability to learn quickly and create useful abstractions for teaching. The project, conducted in my free time, required me to learn nine Ruby libraries which provide Elasticsearch integrations with Ruby and Rails. While these libraries provide excellent API documentation, I saw an opportunity to provide a higher-level explanation of how to effectively design a search feature using these tools. In the presentation, I provide an abstract procedure for doing so, and I back it up with concrete examples. To provide the examples, I wrote the model layer and Elasticsearch integrations for an example Ruby on Rails application. I later made the source for this application available as well.</p>

        <h2 id="workarea-developer-documentation">Workarea Developer Documentation</h2>
        <p>I’ve republished here several articles I’ve written for engineers using the Workarea commerce platform. I created a new stylesheet and “unlinked” some hyperlinks so that these articles can stand alone in this context.</p>

        <h3 id="inventory">Inventory</h3>
        <p>These documents demonstrate a common pattern I use for organizing a topic: a concept document and multiple procedural documents focusing on specific tasks or skills that engineers are commonly asked to complete or acquire. These documents also provide examples of strong introductions, which was the area of my writing I was trying to improve while writing these.</p>

        <p>This document demonstrates the use of screenshots, diagrams, and code examples to explain a topic. This document predates Workarea’s source being publicly available (for hyperlinking), so I provide commands to open the relevant source code files in engineers’ local development environments.</p>

        <h3 id="order-pricing-diagrams">Order Pricing Diagrams</h3>
        <p>Workarea’s architect and lead engineer told me, “I don’t know how you’re going to explain pricing”, referring to the complexity of the topic. To manage this complexity, I created many diagrams. These diagrams worked backward from the user interface to explain a particular price, because this is the task an engineer is most commonly asked to perform regarding pricing. The diagrams deconstruct the UI into <i>pricing totals</i> API calls, which are each derived by summing <i>price adjustments</i>, which are themselves derived from <i>pricing calculators</i>. By reducing pricing to these three concepts, I made pricing more accessible to Workarea engineers.</p>

        <h3 id="commerce-model-diagrams">Commerce Model Diagrams</h3>
        <p>Workarea’s documentation was written by numerous authors over many years. It therefore lacks a coherent narrative. To address this, I created a diagram that models the entire Workarea system, reducing it to a handful of domain concepts. The diagram supports a story of the system that I will use to unify Workarea’s documentation over time. I’ll use variations of the diagram, such as the order pricing example below, to explain how a specific topic or article fits into the overall Workarea narrative.</p>

        <h2 id="workarea-training-exercises">Workarea Training Exercises</h2>
        <p>This source code repository contains a series of commits, each representing the starting point or solution to an exercise included in the <cite>Workarea Fundamentals</cite> workshop I designed. The pattern for most of the exercises is to provide the students with a problem (described in the lecture materials) and some boilerplate (shown here), and then have them complete the solution (also shown here). I developed these exercises along with a turnkey, virtualized development environment and lecture materials for the trainings.</p>

        <h2 id="learn-rails-initialization">Learn Rails Initialization</h2>
        <p>I like to learn through experimentation and exploration. To this end, I regularly create disposable applications to answer specific questions about the software I’m studying. I kept this particular app around because it answered a question that came up again and again on our team: In what order do Rails’ initializers run? Since Rails does not document this sufficiently enough, I created an app that represented our real world scenario, inserted logging code, and generated a log that provided the answer.</p>

        <h2 id="javascript-trivia">JavaScript Trivia</h2>
        <p>As the front-end engineering team lead, I organized and often presented at regular team meetings, which were like internal engineering “meetups” where we’d share knowledge and skills and cultivate our community. At one point, we were trying to build our JavaScript skills across the team. To make this more fun, I created some JavaScript trivia, and we spent several meetings in a row testing our knowledge and explaining each answer. The team enjoyed this because it was interactive, engaging, and <em>challenging</em>. I wrote this many years ago while I was actively engaged in learning JavaScript. I don’t think I could answer many of these now, so please don’t quiz me!</p>

        <h2 id="baseball-score-sheet">Baseball Score Sheet</h2>
        <p>I played a lot of sports growing up, but as an adult I had the pleasure of being on a baseball team with my two younger brothers, and my dad was the coach. Having been removed from sports for many years, I wasn’t a very good player, but I had a lot of fun keeping score at each game. However, the store-bought score sheets we used were a little too “busy” for me. So, I created my own–in HTML and CSS of course!</p>
        <p>
          <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bitbucket.org/chriscressman/baseball-score-sheet/src/master/">

          </a>
        </p>
        <p>While a nice score sheet indeed, I include this here mostly to bring up my background in organized sports. Team sports, particularly demanding year-round sports, likely played a large role in shaping who I am today. I attribute many import life and business lessons to my experiences on these teams, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Determination:</strong> “showing up” (literally and figuratively) every day, even when it’s hard or you don’t want to</li>
          <li><strong>Rapid learning and skill development:</strong> drills, repetition, pushing beyond your comfort zone</li>
          <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> learning from your mistakes; seeing them as opportunities to improve</li>
          <li><strong>Mission:</strong> sharing a vision with others who are equally determined; being a part of something larger than yourself</li>
          <li><strong>Achievement:</strong> trusting the process; watching small gains compound into great achievements</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="progressively-enhance-it">Progressively Enhance It!</h2>
        <p>I presented this talk internally at Workarea and then again at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://2013.barcampphilly.org/">Barcamp Philadelphia 2013</a>. It’s therefore an example of my earlier teaching and community work.</p>
        <p>Although HTML slides are nothing new today, the slideshow tool I wrote for this was pretty novel at the time, and several members of the Barcamp audience complimented me on it. If you feel like checking it out, you can clone the repository:</p>
