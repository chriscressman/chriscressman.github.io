        <p>I’ve chosen the following publicly available examples to represent my work:</p>

        <h2 id="architecting-a-search-feature">Architecting a Search Feature</h2>
        <p>This presentation, delivered to the <cite>Lanacaster Elastic User Group</cite> this past August, demonstrates my ability to learn quickly and create useful abstractions for teaching. The project, conducted in my free time, required me to learn nine Ruby libraries which provide Elasticsearch integrations with Ruby and Rails. While these libraries provide excellent API documentation, I saw an opportunity to provide a higher-level explanation of how to effectively design a search feature using these tools. In the presentation, I provide an abstract procedure for doing so, and I back it up with concrete examples. To provide the examples, I wrote the model layer and Elasticsearch integrations for an example Ruby on Rails application. I later made the source for this application available as well.</p>

        <h2 id="workarea-developer-documentation">Workarea Developer Documentation</h2>
        <p>I’ve republished here several articles I’ve written for engineers using the Workarea commerce platform. I created a new stylesheet and "unlinked" some hyperlinks so that these articles can stand alone in this context.</p>

        <h3 id="inventory">Inventory</h3>
        <p>These documents demonstrate a common pattern I use for organizing a topic: a concept document and multiple procedural documents focusing on specific tasks or skills that engineers are commonly asked to complete or acquire. These documents also provide examples of strong introductions, which was the area of my writing I was trying to improve while writing these.</p>

        <p>This document demonstrates the use of screenshots, diagrams, and code examples to explain a topic. This document predates Workarea's source being publicly available (for hyperlinking), so I provide commands to open the relevant source code files in engineers' local development environments.</p>

        <h3 id="diagrams">Order Pricing Diagrams</h3>
        <p>Workarea's architect and lead engineer told me, "I don't know how you're going to explain pricing", referring to the complexity of the topic. To manage this complexity, I created a large number of diagrams. These diagrams worked backward from the user interface to explain a particular price, because this is the task an engineer is most commonly asked to perform regarding pricing. The diagrams deconstruct the UI into "pricing totals" API calls, which are each derived by summing "price adjustments", which are themselves derived from "pricing calculators". By reducing pricing to these three concepts, I made pricing accessible to all Workarea engineers.</p>

        <h3 id="diagrams">Commerce Model Diagrams</h3>
        <p>Workarea's documentation was written by a variety of authors over a long period of time. It is therefore disjointed and lacks a coherent narrative. To begin to solve this problem, I created a diagram that models the entire Workarea system, reducing it to a cycle of activity. The diagram represents a narrative of the system, which I will use to unite Workarea's disperse documentation over time. Variations of the diagram can be used to explain how a specific topic or article fits into the overall narrative.</p>

        <h2 id="workarea-training-exercises">Workarea Training Exercises</h2>
        <p>This source code repository contains a series of commits, each representing the starting point or solution to an exercise included in the <cite>Workarea Fundamentals</cite> workshop I designed. The pattern for most of the exercises is to provide the students with a problem (described in the lecture materials) and some boilerplate (shown here), and then have them complete the solution (also shown here). I developed these exercises along with a turnkey, virtualized development environment and lecture materials for the trainings.</p>

        <h2 id="learn-rails-initialization">Learn Rails Initialization</h2>
        <p>Rails gives you a lot of places to put initialization code, and the order in which they run is only partially documented. Once, Rails initialization order caused a problem for us twice in the same week, so I decided I wanted to solve this problem. Sometimes the best way to learn is by doing, so I created an application which resembled a real-world Workarea application (with several plugins installed). Then I inserted logging code all throughout the application and plugin to log every possible place initialization could be run.</p>
        <p>The resulting log provided a definitive answer to the order in which all Rails initializers are run. I shared this with the team. This probably took me a couple hours at most and solved an issue that had been hurting us for a while.</p>
        <p>I like to learn through experimentation and exploration. I regularly create disposable applications to answer specific questions about the software. In this case I happened to keep the app as a reference for me and the team, which is good so I can share it with you here.</p>

        <h2 id="javascript-trivia">JavaScript Trivia</h2>
        <p>As the front-end engineering team lead, I organized and often presented at regular team meetings, which were like internal engineering “meetups” where we’d share knowledge and skills and cultivate our community. At one point, we were trying to build our JavaScript skills across the team. To make this more fun, I created some JavaScript trivia, and we spent several meetings in a row testing our knowledge and explaining each answer. The team enjoyed this because it was interactive, engaging, and <em>challenging</em>. I wrote this many years ago while I was actively engaged in learning JavaScript. I don’t think I could answer many of these now, so please don’t quiz me!</p>

        <h2 id="baseball-score-sheet">Baseball Score Sheet</h2>
        <p>I played a lot of sports growing up, but as an adult I had the pleasure of being on a baseball team with my two younger brothers, and my dad was the coach. Having been removed from sports for many years, I wasn’t a very good player, but I had a lot of fun keeping score at each game. However, the store-bought score sheets we used were a little too “busy” for me. So, I created my own–in HTML and CSS of course!</p>
        <p>
          <a class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bitbucket.org/chriscressman/baseball-score-sheet/src/master/">

          </a>
        </p>
        <p>While a nice score sheet indeed, I include this here mostly to bring up my background in organized sports. Team sports, particularly demanding year-round sports, likely played a large role in shaping who I am today. I attribute many import life and business lessons to my experiences on these teams, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Determination: “showing up” (literally and figuratively) every day, even when it’s hard or you don’t want to</li>
          <li>Rapid learning and skill development: drills, repetition, pushing beyond your comfort zone</li>
          <li>Reflection: learning from your mistakes; seeing them as opportunities to improve</li>
          <li>Mission: sharing a vision with others who are equally determined; being a part of something larger than yourself</li>
          <li>Achievement: trusting the process; watching small gains compound into great achievements</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="progressively-enhance-it">Progressively Enhance It!</h2>
        <p>I presented this talk internally at Workarea and then again at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://2013.barcampphilly.org/">Barcamp Philadelphia 2013</a>. It’s therefore an example of my earlier teaching and community work.</p>
        <p>Although HTML slides are nothing new today, the slideshow tool I wrote for this was pretty novel at the time, and several members of the Barcamp audience complimented me on it. If you feel like checking it out, you can clone the repository:</p>
