chronological summary of my background in software

liberal arts education
cofounded and coorganized refresh doylestown as a hobbyist in 2008
joined the front end engineering team at Workarea (then WebLinc)
in 2009
over 5 years grew from my first professional position in software
entry level front end engineer
to Workarea's front end engineering team lead and architect

Refresh Doylestown meetups gave way to internal community building at Workarea
regularly presented skill building, information, team-building sessions
Documented internal standards, procedures, and best practices for my team
Wrote technical articles for the company blog
As team lead, shifted focus to improving others and building the team as a whole

when workarea decided to pivot to a product company
i was chosen as 1 of 2 founding members of the product team
grew by learning the full software stack
continued fostering the internal engineering community
Created and organized the “Workarea Developer: Fundamentals” series to further our internal engineering community
Organized and/or presented bi-weekly presentations and workshops on technical topics relevant to Workarea engineers
Encouraged contributions to Workarea’s products with “Chris Cressman’s Shoutout of the Week”, which engineers coveted (to my delight)

in 2016, when workarea was trying to bring on partners to sell our platform
we needed to introduce those partners engineers to our platform
and begin to build their skills with teh platform
so I developed a 3-day workshop to introduce Workarea to developers and begin to build their skills with the platform
Condensed Workarea fundamentals into a cohesive 3-part narrative
Presented initially to partners, but later adopted as an internal onboarding tool as well
Built a virtualized development environment for workshop attendees, which was later adopted as a general development tool for the Workarea platform
Performed as the initial instructor and later guided other instructors to present the workshop using my materials

during that time i was also writing technical documentation for the platform
we decided i should work on docs exclusively and allow others to continue using my training materials
or develop new ones based on the documentation I produce

Create software documentation which helps engineers develop their skills with the Workarea commerce platform
Develop mental models of topics through independent research, using/testing the software, reading its source, and reverse engineering its design from its implementation
Teach topics through a combination of abstractions and concrete examples (created or curated), organized to serve varying experience levels and learning styles
Evaluate past effectiveness and future priorities through coworker review and reader surveys
Create and maintain conceptual, procedural, and reference (REST/Ruby API) documents; refactoring, redesigning, and evolving them along with the software
Author docs in HTML and Markdown as part of a build system, and as source code annotations and tests which generate documentation
Maintain multiple development environments, demo applications, and sample data for experimentation, debugging, and screenshots
Develop tools to manage and search across 100+ local source code repositories
Remain tightly integrated with Product Engineering through product design meetings, testing, opening issues, and suggesting improvements based on documentation research and outcomes

getting interested in Elastic

This year, I got involved with community events again
lancaster meetup
met bunch of elastic people are started being drawn to elastic

talked to lots of elastic employees so far
drawn to elastic
mission - elastic is a search company
community - devs love elastic
personal growth
  focus on writing, work with other writers
  larger company, more structure
  make an impact at a larger scale
  budget to pursue good ideas and do things right
  ensure a quality bar is met
distributed-first - committed to that style, solitude

what I bring to the table, broad strokes going across my history
my skills; the value I provide

To Elastic, a technical writer is someone who can write documentation aimed at software developers.

combine technical skills and communication skills
elastic has a need for my skills
technical and communication in the same person
the need for good technical writers, those with an enginering background,
is growing

multiplier

i'm a multiplier
educator
mentor
community builder
communicator

I like teaching/educating devs
because of the multiplier aspect of it
as a writer, I'd only have to make 10 people 1x better
or make 20 people 1/2x better
to reach legendary 10x status
since I'm good at it, this is a much better way for me to make
an impact that doing engineering
because there aren't a lot of people that can do what I do
so I sort of feel like it's my calling to do this
to play some kind of important role in furthering software development
through developer education

sustained focus
ability to organize large, complex things
ability to see the simplicity beneath the complexity
building mental models
delivering docs (words and pictures) which communicate those models
the simplicity beneath the complexity

learning software deeply so that its users don't need to
provide them with an abstraction layer that alleviates the need
to read and understand the source

autodidact; excellent self-learner
agressive self education
excited to work with new technology, tools, people
want to come in and learn new things
the ability to learn hard things quickly
mostly due to excellent processes that I've developed over time
good habits
can learn anything with the right plan and effort

vision, committment to long term results, not short term gains
the ability to "show up" every day and make incremental progress
even when there are no immediate gains to keep me motivated

i'm self-directed
i haven't had a manager at work for 5+ years
I take responsibility for myself

ultralearning is hard and frustrating and requires stretching outside
the limits of where you feel comfortable
become good at something that seems impossible to you right now
learning has a cumulative effect
it compounds, like interest
each thing you learn builds your confidence
and makes the next time easier
good habits; active practice and experimentation vs passive learning

a bias toward action
when I want to change something, I _do_ it
losing over 100 lbs
converting my family of 4 to a plant-based diet
fixing my posture
fixing my acid reflux
fixing my flat feet
fixing my sluggishness
learning vim, unix, shell scripting
learning ruby libs for elasticsearch

my skills with my tools are like super powers that make other things easy
like my unix skills

transformed myself physically; now transform my career

work in solitude with bursts of collaboration

i've grown to be fearless
not afraid of what mistakes i may make, or failing or being criticized
which gives me the courage to take on things others wouldn't
and to stick with them when they are difficult

I have great habits

started working remotely in 2017
switched to almost full time in Jan 2018

why I'm drawn to elastic

----------------------------------------------------------------------

personal growth
becoming an amazing writer
haven't identified as a technical writer
in part because technical writing job descriptions don't sound
like the work I do now or the work I want to do
but Kellen's description of the work at Elastic overlaps with my
experience and interests and skills/strengths
like the title documentation engineer
reflects the skills of a softare engineer and a writer/communicator
a have a dual skillset which is rare and valuable

seeking challenges
i learn from my mistakes
i use pain to help me; reflect on pain
i'm determined; i persevere;
i show up every day; i keep pushing, keep making progress
i overcome my obstacles
i see obstacles as opportunities
they are tests of your character and problem solving skills
personal growth is the process of overcoming obstacles,
maintaining your character, and solving problems
ongoing personal growth is what drives me
you're either moving forward or you're moving backward
those without obstacles stagnate
within human nature to face challenges; always have a challenge

want to succeed inside the company and beyond
within the industry at large
want to be surrounded by talent
and be continually challenged

----------------------------------------------------------------------

community

represent and evangelize my company and products at community events
lancaster meetup
philly meetup?
cposc
barcamp
i've done a lot of technical presentations
but also have soft skills

----------------------------------------------------------------------

mission

elastic is a search company
how much the scope of search has changed in the last 10 years
where will it go in the next 10?
it's an exiting question
one that will likely be answered at elastic
i'd like to be a part of that

purpose
having a vision and seeing it through
being part of a larger vision; something larger than myself
setting ego aside, making it about the work
working with other people toward something bigger than you
