Cover Letter
======================================================================

I love software engineering.
At Workarea, a Philadelphia-based ecommerce platform, I quickly grew from entry-level front-end engineer to front-end team lead and architect.
Then, when the company pivoted from client services to product, I pivoted to full-stack application development.
Driving me was the need to always have a challenge; always be learning.
However for as long as I've been learning software development, I've also been teaching it.

In 2008, as a hobbyist, I founded the software engineering community group Refresh Doylestown.
Then, as my professional career began, building an engineering community slowly shifted from suburban Doylestown to Center City Philadelphia, within the walls of Workarea.
There, I surpassed my accomplishments as an individual contributor with my accomplishments as a multiplier--an influencer and enabler focused on making everyone else a little bit better.
Already at the "top" of the organization, I moved around laterally, finding my best fit.
Finally, internal documentation and training efforts transitioned to external, and I found myself in a position of my own creation: technical writer.

In early 2018, along with others at Workarea, I become a full-time remote worker.
It was most likely this change, along with a shrinking engineering team at Workarea, that returned me to the broader engineering community outside of Workarea.

In May of this year, I joined the Lancaster Elastic User Group.
In August, at my third meeting, I presented.
Through this group, I've started to develop relationships with several Elastic employees, most notably Kellen Person, Mike Mulcahy, Mike Newswanger, Jason Stoltzfus, and Court Ewing.
Furthermore, I've been increasing drawn to Elastic--to the products, the company, and the people
I think I have a lot to offer Elastic, and Elastic a lot to offer me.
Please give me a few more moments of your time to elaborate on this:


The Value I See in Me
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To Elastic, a technical writer is someone who can write documentation aimed at software developers.

combine technical skills and communication skills
the need for good technical writers, particularly those with an enginering background, is growing
I imagine Elastic is looking for individuals with this combined skillset
I'll let my resume and portfolio speak for itself regarding my experience, accomplishments, and skills

I'm systematic _and_ creative
  Create software documentation which helps engineers develop their skills with the Workarea commerce platform
  Develop mental models of topics through independent research, using/testing the software, reading its source, and reverse engineering its design from its implementation
  Teach topics through a combination of abstractions and concrete examples (created or curated), organized to serve varying experience levels and learning styles
  Evaluate past effectiveness and future priorities through coworker review and reader surveys
  Create and maintain conceptual, procedural, and reference (REST/Ruby API) documents; refactoring, redesigning, and evolving them along with the software
  Author docs in HTML and Markdown as part of a build system, and as source code annotations and tests which generate documentation
  Maintain multiple development environments, demo applications, and sample data for experimentation, debugging, and screenshots
  Develop tools to manage and search across 100+ local source code repositories
  Remain tightly integrated with Product Engineering through product design meetings, testing, opening issues, and suggesting improvements based on documentation research and outcomes
  learning software deeply so that its users don't need to
  provide them with an abstraction layer that alleviates the need
  to read and understand the source
  solitude

I self-educate, aggressively
  autodidact; excellent self-learner
  agressive self education
  excited to work with new technology, tools, people
  want to come in and learn new things
  the ability to learn hard things quickly
  mostly due to excellent processes that I've developed over time
  good habits
  can learn anything with the right plan and effort
  ultralearning is hard and frustrating and requires stretching outside
  the limits of where you feel comfortable
  become good at something that seems impossible to you right now
  learning has a cumulative effect
  it compounds, like interest
  each thing you learn builds your confidence
  and makes the next time easier
  good habits; active practice and experimentation vs passive learning
  i've grown to be fearless
  not afraid of what mistakes i may make, or failing or being criticized
  which gives me the courage to take on things others wouldn't
  and to stick with them when they are difficult
  personal growth
    focus on writing, work with other writers
    larger company, more structure
    make an impact at a larger scale
    budget to pursue good ideas and do things right
    ensure a quality bar is met
  personal growth
  becoming an amazing writer
  haven't identified as a technical writer
  in part because technical writing job descriptions don't sound
  like the work I do now or the work I want to do
  but Kellen's description of the work at Elastic overlaps with my
  experience and interests and skills/strengths
  like the title documentation engineer
  reflects the skills of a softare engineer and a writer/communicator
  a have a dual skillset which is rare and valuable
  seeking challenges
  i learn from my mistakes
  i use pain to help me; reflect on pain
  i'm determined; i persevere;
  i show up every day; i keep pushing, keep making progress
  i overcome my obstacles
  i see obstacles as opportunities
  they are tests of your character and problem solving skills
  personal growth is the process of overcoming obstacles,
  maintaining your character, and solving problems
  ongoing personal growth is what drives me
  you're either moving forward or you're moving backward
  those without obstacles stagnate
  within human nature to face challenges; always have a challenge
  want to succeed inside the company and beyond
  within the industry at large
  want to be surrounded by talent
  and be continually challenged

I deliver vision and execution
  vision and execution
  vision, committment to long term results, not short term gains
  the ability to "show up" every day and make incremental progress
  even when there are no immediate gains to keep me motivated
  sustained focus
  ability to organize large, complex things
  ability to see the simplicity beneath the complexity
  building mental models
  delivering docs (words and pictures) which communicate those models
  the simplicity beneath the complexity

I'm self-directed and reflective
  i haven't had a manager at work for 5+ years
  I take responsibility for myself
  I have great habits
  a bias toward action
  when I want to change something, I _do_ it
  losing over 100 lbs
  converting my family of 4 to a plant-based diet
  fixing my posture
  fixing my acid reflux
  fixing my flat feet
  fixing my sluggishness
  learning vim, unix, shell scripting
  learning ruby libs for elasticsearch
  I set the agenda for documentation and training
  Designed it from my own understanding of the software
  that I developed over years of experience

I'm a multiplier
  I like teaching/educating devs
  because of the multiplier aspect of it
  as a writer, I'd only have to make 10 people 1x better
  or make 20 people 1/2x better
  to reach legendary 10x status
  since I'm good at it, this is a much better way for me to make
  an impact that doing engineering
  because there aren't a lot of people that can do what I do
  so I sort of feel like it's my calling to do this
  to play some kind of important role in furthering software development
  through developer education
  i'm a multiplier
  educator
  mentor
  community builder
  communicator

community
  community - devs love elastic
  represent and evangelize my company and products at community events
  lancaster meetup
  philly meetup?
  cposc
  barcamp
  i've done a lot of technical presentations
  but also have soft skills

mission
  elastic is a search company
  how much the scope of search has changed in the last 10 years
  where will it go in the next 10?
  it's an exiting question
  one that will likely be answered at elastic
  i'd like to be a part of that
  purpose
  having a vision and seeing it through
  being part of a larger vision; something larger than myself
  setting ego aside, making it about the work
  working with other people toward something bigger than you
