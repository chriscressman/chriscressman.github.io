all my computer skills are self-taught
began working with web software as a hobbyist
learning the skills on my own and applying them to my hobbies
sports, local history
and then to my nonprofit job
until I decided to make a career of it
joining Workarea (then WebLinc) in 2009

Philadelphia suburbs
started working remotely in 2017
switched to almost full time in Jan 2018

However, throughout all that time, I always thought of myself as a software developer
Even in the last few years where all the code I write is examples
But recently, I've experienced a shift in how I identify
And I now think of myself as a technical writer

And I'm excited by this change
And now I'm interested in getting really good at doing this
Just like I did as a software developer

Rare to have technical/code skill and communication skill.

To Elastic, a technical writer is someone who can write documentation aimed at software developers.

Kellen got hired for having a generalist skill set.

Deliberate practice
designing exercises for learning
my "ephiphany" tossing a baton in my yard
my drills throwing a ball against the shed
my list of grinds to practice on my rail every day
