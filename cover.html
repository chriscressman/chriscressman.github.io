    <p>Hi, I’m Chris, and I love software development.</p>
    <p>I’m currently a <em>Sr. Technical Writer</em> at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.workarea.com/">Workarea</a>, where I document and develop an open source, Ruby on Rails ecommerce <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/workarea-commerce/workarea">product</a>.</p>
    <p>I began my career as a front-end web developer and quickly advanced to Workarea’s top position in that role. The company then pivoted from client services to product development and asked me to join one other developer to create Workarea’s (then) 2-person product team.</p>
    <p>As the product team evolved during the next 5 years, I continually reinvented my responsibilities to align my skills with the changing needs of the business. I grew through various roles—full stack application developer, release manager, technical trainer, curriculum designer—into the position providing the best match fit: <em>technical writer</em>. During this evolution, I also transitioned to working remotely, which I’ve been doing full-time for the past 2 years.</p>
    <p>Now, I’m seeking to grow beyond Workarea, and I’m looking toward Elastic.</p>
    <p>I’ve been working with Elastic’s products for years, but I’ve only more recently learned about the company, employees, and community. In May I joined the <em>Lancaster Elastic User Group</em>, and in August I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/chriscressman/architecting-a-search-feature/blob/master/presentation.pdf">presented</a>. Through this group, I’ve met many Elastic employees, including Kellen Person and Jason Stoltzfus from the Swiftype team, who have shaped my opinion of Elastic.</p>
    <p>My interactions with Elastic have revived my enthusiasm for personal growth and my need to share a mission. The Swiftype products are undeniably useful, and their wide market and developer community excite me. I see the <em>Swiftype Sr. Technical Writer</em> position as an opportunity to be a part of this, while also working for a company that understands a remote-first working environment and will encourage my growth as a writer.</p>
    <p>I’d like to talk with you more about this position, which seems to overlap greatly with my experience, responsibilities, domain knowledge, and technical skill set.</p>
    <p>My combination of technical and communication skills is uncommon and valuable, along with my ability to manage large, complex things and find the underlying simplicity. I have the self-motivation and self-direction required for remote work, and I can learn hard things quickly because I’ve developed the skills for planning and the fortitude to finish.</p>
    <p>These strengths have brought me success in all of my various roles, most recently managing and contributing to a large software documentation project, with its competing inputs and priorities, while remaining a member of a product team with a broad set of responsibilities.</p>
