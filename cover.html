    <p>I love software engineering. At <cite>Workarea</cite>, a Philadelphia-based ecommerce platform, I quickly grew from entry-level front-end engineer to front-end lead and architect. Then, when the company pivoted from client services to product, I pivoted to full-stack application development. Driving me was the need to always have a challenge; always be learning. However for as long as I’ve been learning software development, I’ve also been <em>teaching</em> it.</p>
    <p>In 2008, as a hobbyist, I founded the software engineering community group <cite>Refresh Doylestown</cite>. Then, as my professional career began, building an engineering community slowly shifted from suburban Doylestown to Center City Philadelphia, within the walls of Workarea. There, I surpassed my accomplishments as an individual contributor with my accomplishments as a multiplier—an influencer and enabler focused on making everyone else a little bit better. Already at the “top” of the organization, I moved around laterally, finding my best fit. Finally, internal documentation and training efforts transitioned to external, and I found myself in a position of my own creation: technical writer.</p>
    <p>In early 2018, along with others at Workarea, I become a full-time remote worker. It was most likely this change, along with a shrinking engineering team at Workarea, that returned my focus to the broader engineering community outside of Workarea.</p>
    <p>This May, I joined the <cite>Lancaster Elastic User Group</cite>. In August, at my third meeting, I presented. Through this group, I’ve started to develop relationships with several Elastic employees, most notably Kellen Person (Swiftype), Mike Newswanger (Cloud), Mike Mulcahy (Solutions Architect), Jason Stoltzfus (Swiftype), Court Ewing (Kibana), and Paul Springer (Sales). I’ve also been chatting with Gil Raphaelli (APM) about his plans to reboot the <cite>Philadelphia Elastic User Group</cite>, and I’ve committed to speaking at that group in the future.</p>
    <p>Initially drawn to Elastic’s products, I’m now equally charmed by the company and people behind them. When I think about a career at Elastic, I see match quality: employee-employer fit. Allow me to elaborate:</p>
    <p><strong>Value I can provide to Elastic:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>I have technical skills <em>and</em> communication skills.</strong> That combination is uncommon and valuable. I know my audience as a writer, because it’s my past self. I can read code and reverse engineer its design. I create mental models and communicate them to engineers through words and pictures.</li>
      <li><strong>I learn hard things quickly.</strong> Effective teaching requires effective learning. I can learn anything with the right plan and effort, and I’ve developed the processes and habits necessary to execute on such plans again and again. Self-learning is difficult and frustrating, requiring me to stretch beyond the limits of where I feel comfortable. But it’s also cumulative. It compounds, like interest, building my confidence, making each successive try easier.</li>
      <li><strong>I’m fearless.</strong> I’m no longer afraid to make mistakes, fail, or receive criticism. I therefore have the courage to take on things others won’t, and to stick with them when they are difficult.</li>
      <li><strong>I have vision.</strong> I can work in solitude with sustained focus. This allows me to organize large, complex things; to see the simplicity beneath the complexity.</li>
      <li><strong>I execute.</strong> Making vision into reality is hard work. It requires “showing up” and making progress every day. It requires overcoming obstacles, which test your character and problem solving skills. I see these obstacles as opportunities that drive my personal growth and evolution. I’m determined. I persevere.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Value Elastic can provide to me:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>I aspire to grow.</strong> I believe it’s within human nature to face challenges; to always have a challenge. I waited a long time to embrace being a writer (rather than an engineer), and now that I have, I want to be an <em>exceptional</em> writer. I want to flourish within my organization and beyond, into the industry as a whole. To do so, I need an environment where I’m surrounded with talent and will be continually challenged.</li>
      <li><strong>I value community.</strong> Developers love Elastic. I’ve seen it. I’ve experienced it. Elastic’s products inspire developers to act, and I’d be honored to represent and evangelize them at local community events such as <cite>Lancaster Elastic User Group</cite>, <cite>Philadephia Elastic User Group</cite>, <cite>Central Pennsylvania Open Source Conference</cite>, <cite>Barcamp Philadephia</cite>, and more.</li>
      <li><strong>I’m seeking a mission.</strong> It amazes me how the scope of <em>search</em> has changed and grown over the last 10 years. Watching <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.elastic.co/videos/elastic-is-a-search-company">Elastic is a Search Company</a> prompted the question: <i>how will search continue to evolve over the next 10 years?</i> What I don’t question, however, is <em>where</em> that innovation will happen. Having talked to many Elastic employees, I believe they have a shared mission; they are part of something larger than themselves. That is exciting, and <em>I’d like to be a part of it</em>.</li>
    </ul>
